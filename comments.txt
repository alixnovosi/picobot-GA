# Original comments required when this was a class project.

# Comments on my project:

# I tested my code mostly by just running the GA function (usually with 200
# individuals and 10-20 generations), and obseving what happened.  I tried
# changing several variables around, especially the mutation rate and top
# fraction. I also tried messing with the number of states. 
# Some things I noticed: 
# A higher mutation rate got good programs quickly, but was also likely to mess 
# up those good programs.  
# Fewer states led to worse programs, probably because the function had a 
# harder time making good programs with fewer states.

# The best program I ever got was a .95 fitness program. It consistently
# covered .95 of the board, regardless of the starting point, and only ignored
# a strip on one wall of the board (the one behind its direction of motion. It
# moved up and down to cross the room, moving left, and moved all the way to
# the right after reaching the left wall. It did some weird motion that made it
# skip some of the right wall, and then repeated itself. I included it in code
# below, as a program and Picobot. It can be called as bestPicobot.
